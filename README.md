# Project Euler: Problem 1

Welcome to your first assignment! The goal of this exercise is to solve the first problem from Project Euler.

## The Problem

If we list all the natural numbers below 10 that are multiples of 3 or 5, we get 3, 5, 6 and 9. The sum of these multiples is 23.

Your task is to write a function that finds the sum of all the multiples of 3 or 5 below a given number.

## Instructions

1.  Open the `index.js` file.
2.  You will find a function stub named `sumOfMultiples`.
3.  Implement the function to solve the problem.
4.  You can test your implementation by running `node index.js` in the terminal, which will execute a few simple tests.

Good luck!
